<h1>Flake (2011)</h1>

<div><a href="https://anderegg.ca/flake"><img src="./flake.png" alt="A screenshot of the Flake demo, showing pixel snowflakes falling and accumulating on the bottom."></a></div>

<p>This is a small canvas + JavaScript demo inspired by the exit screen of the 1991 game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)#Expansions">Christmas Lemmings</a>. I just wanted to play around with pixel-based drawing in canvas.</p>
