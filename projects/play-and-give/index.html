<h1>MT&L: Play and Give (2010)</h1>

<p>A digital holiday card for clients of MT&L (now NATIONAL Public Relations â€“ Halifax). This was a project with creative direction from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-williams-145b7986/">Paul Williams</a>, design/illustration by <a href="https://www.samiracle.design">Samira Saoud</a>, writing/scenario design by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-beck-667b4535/">Jennifer Beck</a>. I did the development and integration.</p>

<p>We worked together as a group for project brainstorming. We knew we wanted to do something interesting on the web, and eventually landed on the idea of building a small "game". I thought something in the point-and-click space would be pretty easy to build. Having done some work in Flash, this was my first JavaScript-based game-like thing, and I was pretty happy with how it worked out.</p>

<p>In the original version, people could vote where they'd like a donation to go once they finish the game. This was handled by a simple Django app that tallied votes, which we used to manually distribute the donation after the fact. I kept the voting popup as-is, though most of the links no longer work and the voting is stubbed out.</p>
