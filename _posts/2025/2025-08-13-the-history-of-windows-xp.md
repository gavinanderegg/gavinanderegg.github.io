It's interesting seeing [the evolution of Windows XP's interface design in this post](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-windows-xp). Some of the late-90s examples of web-based interfaces shown off here are new to me, but they trigger some deep nostalgia. It's probably best that those interfaces didn't make the cut, as that era web web tech was really slow. Still, they're great to look back on.

I also had no idea that [Frog Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_Design) was involved in the Windows XP interface! I know of them mostly because of their work with Apple. Specifically the [Snow White design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_design_language).
