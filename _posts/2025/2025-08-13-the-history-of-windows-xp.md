It's interesting seeing [the evolution of the XP interface design in this post](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-windows-xp). I like some of the late-90s examples of web-based interfaces shown here. They have a really nostalgic feel for me.

I also had no idea that [Frog Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_Design) was involved in the Windows XP design! I know of them mostly because of their work with Apple. Specifically the [Snow White design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_design_language).
