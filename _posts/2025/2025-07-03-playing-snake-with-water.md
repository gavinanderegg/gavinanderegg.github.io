[Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould) is a science YouTuber whose work I really enjoy. He recently posted a video showing off [an OpenDrop device](https://gaudishop.ch/index.php/product-category/opendrop/) by [GaudiLab](https://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=2). The device is mesmerizing, and he was able to get some simple games developed for it using CoPilot. He explains the physics behind the OpenDrop device, and [shared his code on GitHub](https://github.com/steventhebrave/opendrop-code). Check out the video below, [or on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf-efIZI_Dg).
