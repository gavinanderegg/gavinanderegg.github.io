    Algorithms are breaking how we think

Today, Alec Watson posted a video titled "[Algorithms are breaking how we think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA)" on his YouTube channel, Technology Connections. The whole thing is excellent and very well argued. The main thrust is: people seem increasingly less mindful about the stuff they engage with. Fewer people are reaching out for stuff to read/watch/listen to, and are letting systems control that for them. Watson argues that this is bad, and I agree.

A little while ago I watched a video by Hank Green called "[$4.5M to Spray Alcoholic Rats with Bobcat Urine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfJUSehBMzk)". Green has been banging this drum for a while. He hits some of the same notes as Watson, but from a different angle. Not so much the algorithms bit, rather thinking critically about the stuff the systems like to serve up.

This last month has been a lot, and I've withdrawn from news and social media quite a bit because of it. Part of this is because I've been very busy with work, but it's also because I've felt overwhelmed. There are now a lot of bad-faith actors in positions of power. Part of their game plan is to spray a mass of obviously false, intellectually shallow, enraging nonsense into the world as quickly as possible. At a certain point the bullshit seeps in if you're soaking in it.

The ability to control over what you see next is powerful. I think it would be great if more people started being a bit more choosy about who they give that control to.
