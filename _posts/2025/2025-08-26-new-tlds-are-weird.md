    "New" TLDs are weird

When I bought my first domain, there were only a handful of choices for top-level domains (TLDs). Today [I came across a blog hosted on a `.ooo` domain name](https://becca.ooo/blog/macos-dotfiles/). I haven't thought about these in a while, and had some questions.

First, I wondered when the `.ooo` TLD was created. I went to Wikipedia, only to find that it's not listed on the ["List of Internet top-level domains" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains), but instead in the ["List of English-language generic Internet top-level domains" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English-language_generic_Internet_top-level_domains). I tried looking around for a Wikipedia page that referenced the `.zone` TLD (which is [one I am partial to](http://gavin.zone)), but I wasn't able to find it. While looking, I did see that [`spooky.ooo` is registered](https://www.whois.com/whois/spooky.ooo), but sadly doesn't host anything at the moment.

A better resource is the [Root Zone Database from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db). This is an exhaustive list of TLDs, and each TLD links to a page with more details. From there I learned that [`.ooo` was registered in 2014](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/ooo.html)! There are just so many of these, and `.ooo` is so infrequently used, that I assumed it was new.

I also wondered why it was created. The Root Zone Database entry mentioned [Infibeam Avenues Limited](https://www.ia.ooo/) (turns out to be a fintech firm), but it wasn't clear why they'd want `.ooo`. I found [an entry on the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20250820054012/https://icannwiki.org/.ooo) [^1] which referenced the original application, saying:

> "Our goal is nothing less than providing a billion stores for a billion people. With the `.ooo` [gTLD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) we intend to expand, on a global scale, the valued service we already provide to brick-and-mortar retailers, specifically delivering a dedicated online platform to market their goods and services."

It goes on for much longer than that, but nothing in the description gives me any idea why `.ooo` would help anyone with shopping. The wiki page did link to [this ICANN resource](https://gtldresult.icann.org/applicationstatus/viewstatus) that you can use to [find the original application](https://gtldresult.icann.org/applicationstatus/applicationdetails/152). [^2] The application linked here is significantly longer than the excerpt from the wiki, but I still have no clue how adding three '*o*'s to the end of a URL is shopping-related. Oh well. At the very least, this was a fun diversion into the land of rare TLDs.

[^2]: On this page you need to click the "download public portion of application" text, which strangely starts a download for an HTML document instead of navigating to it.
