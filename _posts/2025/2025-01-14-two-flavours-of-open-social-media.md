Yesterday, the Mastodon team announced it would be handing over control of its project to a [new non-profit organization](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/01/the-people-should-own-the-town-square/). The timing of this announcement is perfect given everything that's happening with [WordPress](https://anderegg.ca/2025/01/11/wordpress-is-in-trouble), [Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341117/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-joe-rogan-lies), and… well, everything else. To date, I think Eugen Rochko has done an excellent job stewarding Mastodon, but I also might have said the same thing about Matt Mullenweg a few years back. Why gamble when you can set up safeguards?

Not to dwell on the WordPress, but I came across a [shockingly prescient post from 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100523152636/http://wpblogger.com/matt-should-resign.php). It lays out potential conflicts of interest between Automattic and the open source WordPress community. [^1] Just about every warning from this post has come to pass in the last few months. It's exactly these sorts of things that Mastodon looks to be trying to prevent with this new organizational structure. The re-org should also give Rochko more time to focus on product design, which sounds like a win in my book.

At this point, I don't think Mastodon will ever take over the world, but it's a cozy place with [stellar](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp) [3rd-party](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) [clients](https://elk.zone/m.webtoo.ls/public/local). It's also where a large contingent of the Apple/tech cohort continue to hang out. Bluesky has really taken off, but Mastodon is still a big part of my social media diet.

Yesterday also saw the launch of the [Free Our Feeds](https://freeourfeeds.com/) campaign. I'm honestly not sure what to make of this, but I think [John Gruber had a great take](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/13/free-our-feeds). The organization is requesting "$30M over three years" to launch "a new public interest foundation that puts Bluesky’s underlying technology on a pathway to become an open and healthy social media ecosystem that cannot be controlled by any single company or billionaire". Only, [that's also Bluesky's goal](https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-15-2023-toward-federation).

I've written before about my [hesitations around the protocol powering Bluesky](https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/15/maybe-bluesky-has-won), and I think that a competing "[AppView](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view)" would be welcome — but it's unclear if that's what Free Our Feeds is going for. They mention wanting to build a second "relay", though I don't know if they're talking about a [Relay](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#relay) in the AT Protocol sense. Another canonical Relay would be a good start, but wouldn't counter any issues if [Bluesky started going off the rails](https://anderegg.ca/2024/11/23/how-decentralized-is-bluesky-really).

I wish the Free Our Feeds people all the best, but I hope they provide a more detailed plan soon. Until then, I think I'll just [continue donating to Mastodon's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/mastodon/posts).
