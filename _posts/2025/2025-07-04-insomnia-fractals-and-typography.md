    Insomnia, fractals, and typography

Last night I woke up for no particularly good reason, and couldn't get back to sleep. When this happens, I usually turn to Wikipedia and read for a bit. This time, I went down rabbit hole about fractals and ended up with typeface envy.

***Warning***: this is a bit of a shaggy-dog story.

Growing up, I was fascinated with [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) and the idea of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). At the time, I had just about zero ability to understand the math involved with these systems, and I mostly just played around with a DOS program called [Fractint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractint). One type of fractal that I was obsessed with at the time was the [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system). I was drawn to it for a few reasons. The math behind it was relatively straightforward, and I had a book with a pseudocode example that I was able to implement crudely. It also had a direct tie to chaos theory, which I thought was rad but only could pretend to understand in an annoyingly teenaged way.

3:30 in the morning is not the best time to try and better understand an obsession from my youth, but apparently that didn't stop me. Happily, I ended up drifted off before too long (though not before bonking myself on the head with my iPad). Before getting back to sleep, I landed on the page for a paper titled *[The fractal property of the Lorenz attractor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167278903004093)*. Realizing I didn't currently have the brains to read it, I added it to [GoodLinks](https://anderegg.ca/2024/12/24/trying-out-goodlinks) and went back to sleep.

This morning I looked up the paper again and was immediately struck by the quality of its typeface. This was a good outcome because the page only contained an abstract, intro, and some snippets. At this point I decided to start being distracted by typography instead of [strange attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor#Strange_attractor).

Looking at the page source, I saw the `font-family` listed as "ElsevierGulliver-Regular". I'm always on the lookout for interesting typefaces for the web, and I didn't think I'd seen this one around before. The face is called Gulliver, and Elsevier is the name of the company behind ScienceDirect.

A search lead me to [Gerard Unger's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Unger). Apparently the face was used mostly in print, and designed in 1993. Wondering if it was available for license, [I found Unger's profile on *Fonts in Use*](https://fontsinuse.com/foundry/1823/gerard-unger). It turns out that this particular typeface was [licensed very selectively](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/39444/gulliver).

> *To guarantee Gulliverâ€™s exclusivity, no more than 100 licences will be issued worldwide.*

Oh well.

Anyway, the upshot of all of this was some typographical envy. I spent a bit of time this morning wondering if I should try out another font on this blog. This is something that happens every few years, but I never act on. The same was true this time. After being intrigued by [Libre Baskerville](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/libre_baskerville_regular), [EB Garamond](https://open-foundry.com/fonts/eb_garamond_regular), and [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif) for a bit, I stopped myself. Any one of them would have [tripled the download size of any page on this website](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/anderegg-ca/).

Instead, I spent a bit of time fiddling with my site's layout. I've increased the body size slightly, and fiddled with how I render links, [^1] but I stuck with my old favourite default web typeface, [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28typeface%29). Happily, it is available for license to more than 100 people ever.

[^1]: One critique of this site's design has been that the links were a bit eye-searing. My [Nope to Sidebar post](https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/28/nope-to-sidebar) contains links to some previous design tweak screenshots. Hopefully this new link style works better for others, because I'm quite happy with it.
