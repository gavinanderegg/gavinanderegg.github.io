I was late to the party, but I played [Luck Be a Landlord](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/) last year and really enjoyed it. It's a deckbuilder where you build combos by manipulating the icons in your custom slot machine. I linked above to the Steam page, but it's on just about every platform — I played through it on iOS.

[TrampolineTales](https://trampolinetales.com/), the indie developer behind Luck Be a Landlord, released a demo for [Maze Mice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385370/Maze_Mice/) as part of Steam Next Fest. I got around to giving the demo a shot today and I loved it!

The game is a slightly weird mix of Pac-Man and Vampire Survivors where time only progresses when you move. You pilot a mouse around a cardboard maze and collect XP gems to earn new weapons and passive effects. You're being chased by cats and ghosts — the cats follow your path exactly around the maze, and the ghosts ignore walls as they move directly toward you. The time progression system is fun, and I found myself *just* squeezing through some tight spots by tapping the arrow keys. There's some light strategy required to herd your foes away from the gems you want to collect.

You can [check out the Steam page for Maze Mice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3385370/Maze_Mice/) and give the demo a go on macOS or Windows. If you liked Vampire Survivors, I think you'll have a good time with this as well.
