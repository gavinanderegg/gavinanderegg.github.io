This morning, [Suzanne Rent wrote a about a birding trip](https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/morning-file/an-early-bird-goes-searching-for-common-nighthawks/) for the Halifax Examiner. After reading that, I decided to look into the nighthawk a bit more. It's sad to learn that they're endangered because of pesticide use, but I'm afraid my biggest takeaway was slightly more crude.

[They have teeny tiny beaks](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Common_Nighthawk_at_Grassland_%2814620802703%29.jpg).

[They also have enormous mouths](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nesting_common_nighthawk_%2853800006659%29.jpg).

Hopefully more can be done to protect these insect munching creatures. [I won't say the same for dreadhawks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz88kJSdT6Y). Those things can frig right off.
