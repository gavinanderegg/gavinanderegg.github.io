So there's this <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal Henderson</a> guy. I first heard of him when I was trying to decide if I should focus on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk">His talk at DjangoCon 2008 made me laugh my ass off</a>. Many of the problems mentioned in this talk have been addressed, but it's still worth watching if you like to chuckle.

Anyway, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGm5i9lQao">the next time I saw this guy was when he was talking about the building of Glitch</a>. His talk was interesting, but I didn't care as much about the game as I did about the technology. The game wasn't coming out for a while and its concept was <em>airy</em>. I didn't quite get it.

Fast forward a little bit and <a href="http://www.1up.com/news/katamari-creator-working-on-different-kind-mmo">I see this come up in my RSS feed</a>. <strong>Holy fuck.</strong> So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keita_Takahashi">Keita Takahashi</a> is going to be working on this? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6O5QXj6n18">Check out that trailer video</a>! I'm now pretty excited about where this thing is going.

There's a <a href="http://glitch.com/">beta signup available on the Glitch website</a>, which also states that the game is being released this year. I'm fairly stoked to give it a shot.
