I volunteer with the Halifax Partnership on their <a href="https://halifaxpartnership.com/how-we-help/support-your-career/">Connector Program</a>. It's an excellent program that helps newcomers to Halifax and new graduates start their professional network and potentially find a new job. One piece of advice I always give during connector meetings is: have a portfolio website with example projects. Maybe I should follow my own advice!

I was reminded of a few Christmas-y projects I worked on a long time ago, and figured I should put them up in an easier to find place. One is an [interactive holiday greeting message](https://anderegg.ca/projects/play-and-give/) that was sent out to clients of MT&L in 2010. Another is a [simple snow-themed HTML canvas demo](https://anderegg.ca/projects/flake/) I made in 2011.

You can check out the [full projects section here](https://anderegg.ca/projects/). I plan to add more to it in the future.
