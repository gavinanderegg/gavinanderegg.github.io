title: Twenty Megabytes of Floating Ducks

This morning, [a friend](https://mrb0.com) shared an interesting website. [It's a lot](https://eastcoastamusements.ca/).

The first thing I noticed was that the index page contained two auto-playing background videos. The one at the bottom (of the titular ducks) is [around 20 megabytes in size](https://eastcoastamusements.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rubber-ducks-floating-in-carnival-game_wkvxoaoxr__D.mp4).

I'm trying not to be too much of an arse here. The design is pretty appropriate for a carnival, I guess! I do take some exception to an initial page load weighing around 40 megabytes, though. Sure, I'd bet just about everyone in the target audience could download it just fine — as long as they're not trying to find carnival details while on the go with sketchy cell service.

Seeing this site reminded me of another example: [the Halifax Burger Bash website](https://burgerbash.ca) [^1]. This is a great local event where restaurants create novel burgers and donate proceeds to a local charity… but the initial site load is around 15 megs. The site also has a clunky map feature, especially on mobile [^2].

[Another friend](https://www.andrewburke.me) was annoyed enough by that to [create a much more usable version of the site](https://burgerweek.shindigital.com). He turned his experience into a talk he calls "[Punk Rock Software](https://www.shindigital.com/blogposts/punk_rock_software_at_next_weeks_halihax_160)", which is a philosophy I'm into. Often something small, quick, and simple beats out a bloated bells-and-whistles filled experience.

While discussing the carnival site, another project I like came up: [1MB Club](https://1mb.club). This is a fun project collecting sites that load in less than a megabyte. I've been building for the web since the mid-90s. The first web hosting account I paid for gave me 1.44 megs of space in total. The size of a 3½-inch floppy disk. This was enough for a surprising amount of content!

Both the carnival site and the burger site were built in WordPress using pre-configured themes [^3]. Even if not loaded down with videos of ducks, these themes are bulky. I'm certain they help speed up site development, but I don't think I've ever been impressed with a site built this way. The challenge is that most web work is commoditized now. It's often easier to get into the groove of LEGO bricking together something with a site builder, or use a large JavaScript framework when a static site would do.

It might be a losing battle, but I continue to push back with some success. This is in part because I've lucked into working with some great companies. Either way, I hope to keep the punk rock vibe going as long as possible.

[^1]: Previously called "Burger Week", it's now "Burger Bash" because it lasts longer than a week.

[^2]: As I write this, [the map page](https://burgerbash.ca/burger-map) is completely covered by an ad when I view it on my phone.

[^3]: The carnival site uses [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/), which is a drag-and-drop page builder. The burger site uses [Listeo](https://purethemes.net/listeo/), a theme for building directory sites. The latter lists "Yacht Charters" as an example use case.
