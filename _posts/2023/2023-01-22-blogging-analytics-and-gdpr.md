The [clown show at Twitter](https://anderegg.ca/2022/11/15/twitter-is-going-great) has reminded me how great it can be to own and control your content. I'd like to blog more, but getting motivated can be tough. As with [many other things](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/NewLight), I find that making some numbers go up can help.

I removed Google Analytics (GA) from my site [almost two years ago](https://github.com/gavinanderegg/gavinanderegg.github.io/commit/d334ad8fc494c44a90fc94f845b831f2b2474b52). I posted so infrequently that the traffic patterns weren't interesting. I also found the old version of GA to be relatively heavy in terms of page load.[^1] Mostly though, I've always been a bit put off by [how much data GA gathers](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9355658?hl=en).

Because it's free, GA is used on a lot of sites. Because it's on a lot of sites, Google can use it to aggregate a lot of data about visitors. This isn't bad *per se*, some site owners get tremendous value from GA! But it was overkill for my needs, and I didn't feel like the trade-off was worth it at the time.

So if I was going to use numbers as my blogging "carrot", what should I use? I briefly considered re-adding GA to my site, but decided against it. The product is in the middle of a [messy transition](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en) from the old version (Universal Analytics) to a new, half-baked version (Google Analytics 4).[^2] I also wanted something lighter that tracked fewer things. I thought about building something myself, but I didn't want the maintenance headache. After looking at some other options, I settled on a trial of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/).

Plausible may not be a great fit for everyone. For example: if you'd like data about [new vs. returning users](https://plausible.io/data-policy#how-we-count-unique-users-without-cookies), it really doesn't help. It has some [basic conversion tracking](https://plausible.io/docs/pageview-goals), but nothing like the mildly creepy [custom conversion setups](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12846214) or [user flow reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9317498?hl=en) you can build with GA. Also, the hosted version of Plausible starts at [$9 USD/month for up to 10k pageviews](https://plausible.io/#pricing).

The minimal amount of tracking that Plausible provided was a plus to me, but the price was a sticking point at first. Happily, the [product is open source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) and setting up a self-hosted version doesn't look too difficult. I figured I'd start with the trial and then see about self-hosting if I liked itâ€¦ but I ended up subscribing after a week. The service was a great fit for my needs, and supporting a small team of developers felt like the right thing to do. If you're interested in seeing a live version of Plausible, [they offer a nice demo with stats from their own site](https://plausible.io/plausible.io).

During this whole period of waffling about stats products, one other point kept bubbling up: [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

I went down quite the rabbit-hole with this, but [the biggest takeaway was the Schrems II case](https://www.gdprsummary.com/schrems-ii/). In short: sending personal data about European users to third-parties in the US can get one sued. A [similar court case](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/31/website_fine_google_fonts_gdpr/) focused on a specific GDPR violation with regards to Google Fonts.[^3]

This seems insane to me, and makes me worry that GDPR (and laws like it) could harm small websites. I don't have a legal team, and it seems to me like it's safer and easier to post my content on Facebook than to have to worry about this stuff myself. I don't want to collect any personal information if I can help it, but I'd also like to try and host content outside of large social media sites.

So, does Plausible protect me from GDPR? I have no idea. It doesn't set any cookies, so I feel better about not showing an annoying cookie consent dialogue. But I'm still loading content from a third-party, which means people visiting my site are having their IP addresses forwarded somewhere else. [Plausible make a solid case for themselves](https://plausible.io/data-policy), but it's unclear to me how much that matters. As a tiny speck on the internet, I feel that it's probably fine either way. I'd just like to do as close to the correct thing as possible.

I just wish I didn't have to consider international law when setting up web stats!

[^1]: [My site is pretty svelte](https://1mb.club), and Google Analytics added something like 40% to the total page load time when I last checked.
[^2]: As a side note: I'm currently helping some clients with this, and it's a major pain.
[^3]: I'd removed Google Fonts from my site over [just over a year ago](https://github.com/gavinanderegg/gavinanderegg.github.io/commit/2c7a0b48e09b46621751e166a5b90fce8cea8bb8), but it was mostly another way to reduce the page load.
