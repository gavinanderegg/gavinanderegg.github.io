Catching up on my RSS feeds this morning, I came across the article "[Graphing Calculator and Grapher](https://eclecticlight.co/2024/05/04/graphing-calculator-and-grapher/)" from Howard Oakley on The Eclectic Light Company.

I switched to the Mac in 2002, so I missed the original Graphing Calculator. When I got Grapher in 2005, I was quite happy with it! I still find it useful on occasion. It's great to hear that [the original is available for free on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/graphing-calculator-4/id522175477?mt=12) and that it's still being updated. The [website for the app](http://www.pacifict.com/Products.html) has more details, and [includes a fun gallery of user submitted equations](http://www.pacifict.com/usersgallery.html).

Also, the stories linked to in Oakley's blog post are amazing. If you've got some time today, I recommend [reading the account of how this got built](http://www.pacifict.com/Story/) or checking out the [2006 Google Tech Talks video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMyg5ohTsVY).
