[Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net), who I first learned of because of [Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com), posted an excellent article: "[Fighting for our web](https://www.citationneeded.news/fighting-for-our-web/)".

Sometimes it's hard to understand how special a technology is once it's commonplace. 30 years ago, only the most powerful people in the world could publish their thoughts for everyone to read. Now most people put their thoughts in bite-sized chunks on someone else's platform.

To me, it's still magical to be able to publish things on the web. I love having control over how I push things out, even if fewer people might read them. It's been great seeing a groundswell of self-publishing folk rise up over the past few years, and I've been so happy to participate and spread the word. I really hope this momentum continues, and we get more folks excited to create things in their own spaces.
