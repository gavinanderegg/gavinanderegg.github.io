This morning I saw [a Bluesky post from Andy Baio](https://bsky.app/profile/andy.baio.net/post/3l7mkfiimd42y) mentioning that [Too Many Cooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Many_Cooks_(short)) was released 10 years ago.

If you haven't seen it before, [you should check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGrOK8oZG8).

[Baio posted about the short](https://waxy.org/2014/11/too_many_cooks/) a few days after it first aired, but I only saw the post today. He points out a bunch of easter eggs I'd never noticed, including some [great IMDB gags](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3534838/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast), and specifically the [IMDB page for William Tokarsky](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6085243/).
