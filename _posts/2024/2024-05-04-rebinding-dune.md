I'm a huge fan of video series where a competent professional shows off their craft in a calm and informative way. The YouTube algorithm seems to have figured this out, and recently served up a series about rebinding an early edition of [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)).

The series is produced by [Four Keys Book Arts](https://www.youtube.com/@FourKeysBookArts), and goes over sourcing the book, planning the project, and the long process of a fully custom rebind. It's a joy to watch.

You can check out the existing three episodes here:

* [Rebinding DUNE - Part 1 - Disassembling A Vintage Book: Paper Repair & Resewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqGPXpfp-CU)
* [Rebinding DUNE - Part 2 - Rescuing A Vintage Book: Custom Endpapers, Backing & Covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQDnVT8CkoE)
* [Rebinding DUNE - Part 3 - Upgrading A Vintage Book: Cover Flap, Magnets & Leather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFpkMwn3wpc)

There's at least one more episode to come, and I'm really looking forward to it! I've also started digging back through the archives and there's a lot more great stuff to see, including the creation of a [mega D&D book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijri1nvw8FY).
