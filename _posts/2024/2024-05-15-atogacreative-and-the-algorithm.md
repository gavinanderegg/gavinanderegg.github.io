I'm not an algorithmically driven feed kinda person, but I've mostly given up fighting with YouTube on this. Their recommendations are quite good most of the time, and they at least provide RSS feeds for channel pages.

Ever so often, the algorithm serves up something really great. Earlier this week I saw the thumbnail for *[frog frog frog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMGyTU2nDPg)* by [AtogaCreative](https://www.youtube.com/@AtogaCreative). I watched it, loved it, and think the view count is criminally low.

I then looked through the back-catalogue and found some other excellent short animations: *[How to be a monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbTijXG-PJo)*, *[Blahaj can't swim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jz9P4Nofbc)*, and *[oink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdfL1nQInxQ)*. They're all cute 3D animations with great music by Atoga. You can also check out their music on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/atoga/1732708044) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7frvOv4AmqH9BQ2sxSBCZd?si=dY5KGDjNT_uJOqjfe_BAUg).
