Earlier this week my city councillor, [Waye Mason](https://wayemason.ca/), put out [the latest edition of his newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/43787ea566ca/budget-202324-tax-relief-district-7-capital-projects-more-16182391?e=8a7364fb1d). In it, he included a link to [a video tour of the Power House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORVE-BQKXUs).

I've have walked by this building hundreds of times. I'm sure I've wondered about what it was used for, but never enough to look it up. Turns out, it's [a really cool youth centre](https://www.halifax.ca/parks-recreation/youth/youth-spaces/power-house-youth-centre)!

The most interesting part to me is "The Lair" — a dedicated space for playing Dungeons & Dragons. From the video and images on the site, it looks like it's well equipped with miniatures and books.

The space offers much more beside excellent D&D hosting, but I love that table-top role playing is something youth centres offer now! It brings me joy knowing that this a part of my community.
