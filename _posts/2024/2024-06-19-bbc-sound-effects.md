I just saw [this Mastodon post](https://infosec.exchange/@0xabad1dea/112643323096146636) from [Melissa Elliott](https://github.com/0xabad1dea) pointing to the [BBC Rewind Sound Effects archive](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk). It's a collection of 33,066 miscellaneous sounds from the BBC's back catalogue. There's an [astonishingly plain language Licensing page](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/licensing) that mentions that the sounds can be [freely used for non-commercial purposes](https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/licensing#:~:text=personal%20or%20research%20purposes). I wasn't able to turn up any [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) noises, but it's still a fun collection of audio clips for side projects.
