When I [waffled about template-based XML](https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/24/on-templatebased-feed-generation), I mentioned that I discussed my issue with a friend. That friend, Mike Burke, wrote a follow-up post: [*On generating structured data from templates*](https://mrb0.com/2024/06/17/on-code-generation-from-templates/). It has several examples that demostrate the sorts of trouble you can get into when sticking data into a structured format. I agree with everything he's said, but still feel that RSS/Atom feeds are likely "safe enough" to template.

Unrelatedly, Meta launched their [Threads API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads) today. I looked through the supplied [sample app](https://github.com/fbsamples/threads_api/tree/main) and found that they're using the [Pug templating system](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). I hadn't heard of this before, but it's similar to the [htmltag](https://github.com/LiftoffSoftware/htmltag) library that Mike used as an example in his post. Even more than with syndication feed templates, I feel that almost all HTML on the web isn't valid. Some might perfer to use templates like these, but I've been writing HTML for 30 years at this pointâ€¦ so I'll probably keep doing that.

Those two instances aside, I will definitely continue using a library to generate JSON, XML, and especially SQL.
