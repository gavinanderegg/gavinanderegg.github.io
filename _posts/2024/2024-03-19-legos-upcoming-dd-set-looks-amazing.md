LEGO has teamed up with a lot of other brands over the years, but this one in particular seems aimed directly at me. A new [Dungeons & Dragons themed LEGO set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dungeons-dragons-red-dragon-s-tale-21348) will be launching on April 1st, 2024. I'm a [sucker for tabletop games](/2024/03/06/a-nasa-rpg-adventure) and also for LEGO in general, so I'm very tempted by this.

I first learned of it via [a great Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105862/lego-dungeons-and-dragons-pictures-price-release-date), which has more details including a photo of the included one-shot campaign. Also, if you order before April 8th, you'll get a [bonus mimic chest](/assets/lego-dnd-mimic-chest.jpg)? That is some powerful FOMO-based marketing.

Looking at this, I was curious about when all the LEGO brand partnerships started. As far as I can tell, it seems to have started in [1999 with a Star Wars set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_timeline#1990s:~:text=Lego%20produces%20the%20first%20licensed%20theme%20with%20Lucasfilm) tied to the release of [The Phantom Menace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace). More recently, [LEGO Fortnite has been a big hit](https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/23990575/lego-fortnite-release-date-how-to-play), and the [list of LEGO set themes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lego_themes) is increasingly filled with IP from other brands. It's wild to see how much LEGO has embraced the "metaverse" idea.
