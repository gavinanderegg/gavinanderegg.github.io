Turns out you can release a [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) game on Steam if it's packaged correctly. Beside being a nerdy oddity, this game is extremely well made and quite fun! Lots of [Castlevania II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_II:_Simon%27s_Quest) vibes going on here. [Check out Anzu Castle Gracula on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3125600/Anzu_Castle_Gracula/), or [give it a shot on Itch.io](https://rainbowcemetery.itch.io/anzu-castle-gracula).
