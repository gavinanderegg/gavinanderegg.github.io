When I was starting to do more serious data work, I picked up a copy of the first edition of *Python for Data Analysis*. I really liked the book, and it helped me get familiar with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

Turns out that it's now [available to read freely online](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)!

The book is written by [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/), who is the creator of pandas as well as the co-creator of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/). This edition was released in 2022 and uses Python 3.10 and pandas 2.0, so it still holds up well. The beginning of the book also walks through some intro Python concepts, so it's useful if you're coming to Python from another language.

To me, the core value of the book is its overview of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and pandas. If you're a developer interested in using Python for anything data-related, you should give this book a shot.
