I didn’t write about it yesterday, but I decided to try my hand at [Weblog Posting Month](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) this year. I was on the fence about this, as I’m not sure I can post something every day… but what the heck, I'll give it a shot!

At the end of last year I wrote about [wanting to post more to this site](https://anderegg.ca/2023/12/29/building-a-better-web-in-2024). I had a deal with myself last year that I wanted to post at least once a month. I got 14 posts in, which felt good. I’m already up two on that so far in 2024, and that feels even better.

One thing I'm still struggling with how I want to use this site if I'm posting to it more. I worry that it might be annoying to post a lot of short form content. At the same time, I'm [subscribed](https://ruk.ca/) [to](https://kottke.org/) [a](https://512pixels.net/) [bunch](https://daringfireball.net/) [of](https://kevquirk.com/) [blogs](https://rknight.me/) that often post short articles and I like seeing them in my RSS reader.

I also need to keep reminding myself that I'm posting to this site because I like doing it. I find it helps me think to write things down, and it's also sometimes therapeutic. Writing [the piece about TikTok](https://anderegg.ca/2024/04/30/trying-to-understand-the-tiktok-ban) was really difficult, but my thinking about that issue is a lot clearer [after having gotten it to a place where I was happy publishing the post](https://kottke.org/20/08/i-hate-to-write-but-i-love-having-written).

I read [a great post this morning my Molly White](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/). She reminded me once again about the days when the web was wild and weird. She also reminded me that those days aren't gone! It's still wild to me that anyone can put stuff out into the world. I grew up in a time when this absolutely was not the case. There's nothing wrong with doing this on one of the big platforms, but there's something very powerful about [owning your content](https://anderegg.ca/2024/03/28/what-does-it-mean-to-own-your-content).

Hopefully I'll use this month to better understand how I want to post here. I promise it won't all be writing about writing!
