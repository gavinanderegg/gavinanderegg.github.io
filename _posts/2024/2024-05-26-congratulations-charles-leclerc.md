The [2024 Monaco Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Monaco_Grand_Prix) got off to an insane start. There were three incidents on the first lap — each would have been race-defining in any other year. Then things settled into a rhythm, with only a minor blip of interest for the remaining laps. I was still glued to my screen with tense excitement. I have never been this happy for the top 10 positions stay unchanged.

I got into F1 mid-season in 2020 because of [Drive to Survive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive). I'd followed F1 from afar before then via the coverage on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/tag/formula-1/). Formula 1 cars are effectively rocket ships on four wheels, and they generate a huge amount of data every race. This was interesting, but I wasn't really engaged until Drive to Survive showcased the spectacle, strategy, and the stories.

Today was the end of a huge storyline. One filled with disappointment and heartbreak. I'm glad it was a happy ending. Congrats, Charles! It's been a long time coming, and it's well deserved.
