[The Games Behind Your Government's Next War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k) is a fascinating look into government funded gaming by the folks at [People Make Games](https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames).

In the video, People Make Games was invited to [The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory) (DSTL) to discuss how gaming is used to simulate conflicts. It's intersting to see how board games, video games, [tabletop RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game), and even [LARPing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game) can be useful tools in a military context. The video raises difficult questions about how something I primarily think of as a fun hobby can have dire real-world consequences when put in a different light. On the other hand, it also highlights how gaming as a medium for simulation can be an extremely powerful tool for solving extremly difficult problems.

[It's a 43-minute video, but it's definitely worth your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k).
