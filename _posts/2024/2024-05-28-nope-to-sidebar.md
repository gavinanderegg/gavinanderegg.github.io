title: Nope to Sidebar

I decided to blow up the sidebar. I promise this wasn't a way to get [two easy posts in May](https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/02/weblog-posting-month-2024).

When looking at the design on mobile, I realized that I liked that much better than the desktop view. I played around with the sidebar design a lot to see if I could salvage it, but decided that a nav bar across the top looked much better to me. I also played with the header and footer design a bit while I was at it.

The main issue I was trying to solve was the ability to add more links. Having the links across the top of the site solves this, and I was able to make this work in a way that I think looks OK on mobile. I also liked the darker band of colour across the top in the mobile design, and I think it works just as well on desktop. To balance that out, I made the footer darker — but I used a gradient there as pages with little content might pull the footer up to the point where the original background colour is visible below it.

All of this fiddling has made want to rethink the design from the ground up. I might end up doing some redesign work in the background, but it won't be something I put live for a while.

For posterity, here are some screenshots of the design progress from Sunday to today:
