[NiGHTS into Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams) is one of those games I tend to think about when Christmas rolls around. It's one of my favourites from the Saturn lineup, and it also had [a free Christmas version](https://www.mobygames.com/game/12695/christmas-nights-into-dreams/).

In it, there's a song I really love that plays on the level select screen called *Gate of Your Dream*. You can check it out on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/gate-of-your-dream/573385917?i=573386172) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/0szbcIBKgUpq1GB2Gp70FX?si=5e7e9940c4ae4638). Around 8 seconds into the track, you can hear someone saying "*hello? helllooo?*". That someone is [Macaulay Culkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin), and the sample is from [Home Alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone).

The clip happens near the beginning of the film after Culkin's character heads down to the basement after he's home alone (spoilers). You can [watch the scene in question on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ceJ5_Q4bs), conveniently turned into an ad by a home heating company. [^1]

This is something I discovered when rewatching the film in 2020. I totally did the [pointing at the TV screen meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pointing-rick-dalton) when I heard it — the NiGHTS song is burned into my brain, but I hadn't seen Home Alone since it was in theatres.

I still have no idea how or if this sample was licensed.

[^1]: … for as long as that lasts. The scene takes place around 20 minutes into the version of the film that's on Disney Plus.
