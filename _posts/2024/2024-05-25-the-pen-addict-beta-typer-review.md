Earlier this week, [The Pen Addict](https://www.penaddict.com/) posted a review of the [Mad Science Pen Company Beta Type-R](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2024/5/22/mad-science-pen-company-beta-type-r-vanness-collaboration-fountain-pen-review).

First off, I don't think I've ever seen a fountain pen like this before? I love the design of the cap and grip! The cap looks easy to remove, but the two o-rings should form enough of a seal to keep ink from drying. I'd really like to try this grip design, too. It looks pleasant to hold, and the way it cowls the nib is inspired. I'm also very fond of the colours used on the example in the review.

I hadn't heard of [Mad Science Pen Company](https://madsciencepencompany.com/en-ca) before, but it looks like they do small runs and are currently sold out. I'll definitely keep an eye on their work.
