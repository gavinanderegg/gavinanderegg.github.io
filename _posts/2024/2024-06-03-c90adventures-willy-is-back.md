I really enjoyed following [the adventures of Willy the mini-Jeep](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiUJqMrz7-QM8jCIKhGcL0gse4mglPS80) last year. Ed March, who runs the [c90adventures channel](https://www.youtube.com/@c90adventures), decided to buy a cheap motorized mini-Jeep, modify it heavily, and then drive it on a long journey over some treacherous trails. I stuck around because of Ed's sense of humour and insane tenacity.

Ed's now [started a new series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVulirXlUuE), and it's even more fun so far! An even more upgraded Willy is back, with many more tricks to hand. If you liked some of the old [Top Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)) adventures, you'll want to check this out.
