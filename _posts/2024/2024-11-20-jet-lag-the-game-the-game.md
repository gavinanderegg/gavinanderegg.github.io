Some fun news today from the creators of [Jet Lag: The Game](https://www.youtube.com/@jetlagthegame). They officially announced the next season, and also a "home version" of the game. [I've written about Jet Lag: The Game before](https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/21/travelling-for-the-enjoyment-of-others), so you might want to start there if you don't know what I'm talking about.

[On the latest episode of The Layover](https://nebula.tv/thelayover) (a Nebula subscriber exclusive podcast), the Jet Lag team discussed the rules for the [new season](https://nebula.tv/videos/jetlag-season-twelve-trailer) starting on December 4. It's another round of hide and seek, but this time in Japan. The first hide and seek season was in Switzerland, and it was my favourite so far. The twist this time is that they're using a version of the rules that [anyone can purchase](https://store.nebula.tv/products/hideandseek). This is some genius-level marketing, and I'm now wondering if I have any friends crazy enough to give this a shot.
