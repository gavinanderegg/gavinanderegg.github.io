Here's a neat project from my friend Andrew Burke: [Bloomsday Halifax](https://bloomsdayhalifax.ca), which takes place in Halifax, Nova Scotia on Sunday June 16, 2024.

[Andrew](https://www.andrewburke.me) has put this on [previously in 2018](https://www.shindigital.com/blogposts/144), but this year sounds like it should have a bit more going on. He's also worked on some other fun [art/app integrations](https://www.shindigital.com/blogposts/107) in the past.

Even if you haven't read [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)), this should be a time if you're in the area. Like with [WeblogPoMo](https://anderegg.ca/2024/05/02/weblog-posting-month-2024), saying something in public is a pretty good motivator for me to try and do it. So here's me pledging to actually try and get myself through Ulysses this year. Hopefully it'll actually stick this time!
