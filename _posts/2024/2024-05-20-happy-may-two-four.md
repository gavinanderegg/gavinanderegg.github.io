In Canada we celebrate [Victoria Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Day), which is kind of a strange holiday. It's in honour of [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria), who was Canada's monarch during the time of [Canadian Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Confederation). Her birthday was May 24th, but the holiday is celebrated on the last Monday before May 25th, so it moves around.

I grew up on [Prince Edward Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island), which was named after [Victoria's father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Kent_and_Strathearn). It's the smallest Canadian province, and was where the [Charlottetown Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottetown_Conference) took place in 1864. The conference was where the whole "Canada as a country" thing got kicked off in earnest, so it's a prominent part of Prince Edward Island's culture.

I took all of this for granted for a long time. People in the UK must also celebrate Victoria Day, right? Or people in other former British colonies? [Turns out, no](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/victoria-day-only-in-canada/)! It's a weird, Canada-only thing. It was also commonly "May Two-Four", both as a nod to Victoria's birthday, but also because of another Canadian thing — the "two four", or [24-pack of beer](https://www.mynslc.com/en/products/Beer/Lager/Pale%20Lager/1000397.aspx) that some would also buy for the long weekend.

So have a happy May Two-Four, and happy sort-of-birthday to Queen Victoria!
