I really loved Steve Jackson's [*Fighting Fantasy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) series of books back in the 90s. They were like the [*Choose Your Own Adventure*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) books, but with RPG elements like an inventory system and dice-driven combat.

I was reminded of these when I came across some books by [Gordon Little](https://gord.games/about.html). He's published two books, [*Paper Dungeon Mazes*](https://gord.games/paper-dungeon-mazes.html) and [*Paper Dungeon Mazes 2*](https://gord.games/paper-dungeon-mazes-2-2.html). Both are top-down, dice-driven dungeon crawling adventures. The first is pretty straightforward, but the second adds some light story and an extra mechanic. They're [available as PDFs from itch.io](https://gordgames.itch.io/), but also as [physical books](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BCSH4N1L) [through Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CD163C6T) at reasonable prices.

Nostalgia aside, I was drawn to these books by the idea of self-publishing. Amazon has its [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com/) service for print and digital production. My print version of *Paper Dungeon Mazes* is listed as being "Manufactured by Amazon.ca — Bolton, ON". It's exciting to know there are services for printing this sort of thing on demand, and I'm quite happy with the end product.

I ended up buying a few more physical copies around Christmas as gifts for some geeky friends, and they went over well. I really wish these had've been around in the 90s, as they would have been perfect for long car trips.
