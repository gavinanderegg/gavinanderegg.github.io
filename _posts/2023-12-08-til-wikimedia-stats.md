Today I learned that Wikimedia (the organization behind Wikipedia) [hosts public stats dashboards](https://analytics.wikimedia.org). In particular, I found the [User Agent Breakdowns dashboard](https://analytics.wikimedia.org/dashboards/browsers/#desktop-site-by-browser) to be interesting. Also cool is the [general Wikipedia dashboard](https://stats.wikimedia.org/#/en.wikipedia.org). Always great seeing organizations sharing stats like this publicly!
