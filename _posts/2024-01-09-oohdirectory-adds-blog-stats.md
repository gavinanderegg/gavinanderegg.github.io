[ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory) is a really neat list of blogs and indie web sites. I first found out about it when it was [posted to Hacker News in late 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983). Browsing through the directory is a fun way to spend some time. It brings me back to the days of "surfing the web" using [Yahoo!'s directory feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Directory) in the mid-90s.

I hadn't checked back on the site in a while, but it's been improved recently. Today I saw a [Mastodon post](https://mastodon.social/@OohDirectory/111715394258448023) announcing individual stats pages for every site the directory tracks. I love this feature!
