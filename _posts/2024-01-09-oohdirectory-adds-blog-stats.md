[ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory) is a really neat list of blogs and indie web sites. I first found out about it when it was [posted to Hacker News in late 2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983). It's fun to browse through the sites listed on there, and it reminds me slightly of "surfing the web" using [Yahoo!'s directory feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Directory) in the mid-90s.

I missed it when it was first posted, but I saw a [Mastodon post](https://mastodon.social/@OohDirectory/111715394258448023) today announcing detail view pages for every site in the directory. [Here's the page for anderegg.ca](https://ooh.directory/blog/82jj26/). This is a great feature, and seeing stats like this for my own site is pretty fun!
