title: Twitter is Going Great!
---

[I signed up for Twitter in 2008](https://twitter.com/gavinanderegg/status/585855592). This was [before retweets were an actual feature](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/retweet-limited-rollout.html) and back when [likes were called favorites](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/hearts-on-twitter.html). It was the wild west. No one really knew what the platform was for, but it was fun just playing around. I enjoyed using Twitter for a long time.

My enjoyment started dropping off around 2015. Slowly at first, but much more rapidly in 2021. At the beginning of 2022 I tried to use the service less. I found it tricky, as Twitter had become a habit. [For reasons that might be obvious](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23423708/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-close-san-francisco), I find it much easier now.

All this said, I'm still a news junky. I've been reading a lot more [using RSS](https://reederapp.com) and have signed up for some [fun newsletters](https://www.garbageday.email). One story I just can't quit is everything happening at Twitter the company. Sources like [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com) and [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news) are covering it well, but the shamblefest is non-stop.

That's why I was happy to find *[Twitter is Going Great!](https://twitterisgoinggreat.com)* (a project inspired by [Molly White's](https://www.mollywhite.net) *[Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com)*). It's not clear how well this service will keep on top of things, but at least a timeline of the ongoing garbage fire will be helpful and likely amusing. Looking at the about page for the project also provided a nice surprise: Molly White published an [open-source timeline generator](https://github.com/molly/static-timeline-generator), which powers the site. Handy!
